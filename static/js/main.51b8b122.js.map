All other props will be passed through to the internal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>\\ntag.</p>\\n<p>If you wish to replace the current url instead of pushing, use the <code>replace</code> prop\\ninstead of the <code>to</code> prop.</p>\\n<p>Unlike any other router, the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component can also create abstract routes\\nfrom a list of route parameters. With this route declaration:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">const routes = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;Route name=&quot;biff&quot; path=&quot;/this/:fancy(/:thing)&quot; /&gt;\\n  &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>we can create a link like so:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">const App = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;Link route=&quot;biff&quot; fancy=&quot;hi&quot; thing={some.dynamicValue} /&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and if the dynamic value refers to <code>123</code> the route will link to <code>/this/hi/123</code></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"extending-the-example-asynchronous-state-loading\\\">Extending the example: asynchronous state loading</h3>\\n<p>What if we are loading the todo list from a database?  There will be a short delay while\\nthe list is loaded, and the user will just see an empty list of todos.  If they add a todo,\\nthe todo id could suddenly conflict with todos the user creates, which would erase them on the\\ndatabase load.  Better is to display a different component while loading.</p>\\n<p>To implement this with our router, you will use:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>a loading component that will be displayed when the todos are loading</li>\\n<li>a &quot;Toggle&quot; higher order component that is used to switch on/off display of a\\ncomponent or its loading component</li>\\n<li>an asynchronous program to load the todos from the database.</li>\\n<li>an additional way of marking whether state is loaded or not in the store, and\\nactions and reducer code to capture this state.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>redux-saga is an excellent solution for expressing complex asynchronous actions in a\\nsimple way.  You can write your asynchronous loader in any manner you choose, whether\\nit is a thunk, saga, observable, or fill-in-your-favorite.</p>\\n<p>For this example, we will assume that you can add a simple &quot;loaded&quot; field to the todos\\nreducer, and actions to set it to true or false.</p>\\n<p>Let&#39;s design the loading component first:</p>\\n<p>Loading.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\n\\nexport default () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;h1&gt;Loading...&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Asynchronous loading of the todo items from the database can be accomplished with a very\\nsimple saga.  The saga assumes that the todos can be accessed via a REST service that\\nreturns JSON, and uses the axios library to make an xhr call to retrieve it from the\\nserver at the <code>&quot;/getTodos&quot;</code> address.</p>\\n<p>loadTodosSaga.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { call, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport axios from &#39;axios&#39;\\n\\nimport * as actions from &#39;./actions&#39;\\n\\nexport default function *loadTodos() {\\n  // mark loading as starting\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(false))\\n  const todos = yield call([axios, axios.get], &#39;/getTodos&#39;)\\n  // a new action for setting all of the todos at once\\n  yield put(actions.setTodos(todos))\\n  // mark loading as finished\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(true))\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now let&#39;s create a Toggle.  A Toggle is a higher order component that responds to state in order\\nto turn on or off the display of a component, like a toggle switch.  It takes 2 callbacks as parameters.\\nEach callback receives the state as a parameter and should return truthy or falsey values.  The first is\\nused to determine whether the main component should be displayed.  The second optional callback is used\\nto determine whether state is still loading, and if so, whether to display the loading component.\\nBy default, if no loading callback is passed in, a Toggle assumes that the state is\\nloaded.</p>\\n<p>In our example, there is only 1 route, and so we will display it if our state is marked\\nas loaded.

Why create a new router?\\nIn my work with react-router, I found that it was not possible to achieve\\nsome basic goals using react-router. I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to store state from\\nurl parameters and easily change the url from the state when using redux. It is the\\nclassic two-way binding issue: if there are 2 sources of state, they will fight and\\ncause unexpected bugs.</p>\\n<p>In addition, I moved to redux for state because the tree of components in React rarely\\ncorresponds to the way data is used.  In many cases, I find myself rendering different\\nportions of the component tree using the same data. So I will have 2 React components\\nin totally different parts of the component tree using the same piece of data.\\nWith react-router, I found myself duplicating a lot of content with a single component,\\nor using complex routing rules to enable displaying this information.  react-router\\nversion 4 allows declaring the same route multiple times throughout the code, but\\nthis can make things more confusing, and opens up another vector for bugs since\\nroute information must be duplicated wherever it is used.</p>\\n<p>With ion-router, multiple components can respond to a route change anywhere\\nin the React component tree, allowing for more modular design.  The below solution\\nis more performant both because the components\\nare not rendered at all if the route is not satisfied.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\nimport Routes from &#39;ion-router/Routes&#39;\\nimport Route from &#39;ion-router/Route&#39;\\nimport Toggle from &#39;ion-router/Toggle&#39;\\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;\\n\\nimport * as actions from &#39;./actions&#39;\\n\\nconst albumRouteMapping = {\\n  stateFromParams: params =&gt; ({ id: params.album, track: +params.track }),\\n  paramsFromState: state =&gt; ({\\n    album: state.albums.selectedAlbum.id,\\n    track: state.albums.selectedTrack ? state.albums.selectedTrack : undefined\\n  }),\\n  updateState: {\\n    id: id =&gt; actions.selectAlbum(id),\\n    track: (track, state) =&gt; state.id &amp;&amp; actions.playTrack(track)\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconst TrackToggle = Toggle(state =&gt; state.albums.selectedTrack,\\n                           state =&gt; state.albums.selectedTrack\\n                            &amp;&amp; state.albums.allTracks[state.albums.selectedTrack].loading)\\nconst AlbumToggle = Toggle(state =&gt; state.albums.selectedAlbum)\\n\\nconst AlbumList = ({ albums, selectAlbum }) =&gt; (\\n  &lt;ul&gt;\\n    {albums.map(album =&gt; &lt;li key={album.id} onClick={selectAlbum(album.id)}&gt;{album.name}&lt;/li&gt;)}\\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\\n)\\n\\nconst AlbumDetail = ({ album, playTrack }) =&gt; (\\n  &lt;ul&gt;\\n    &lt;li&gt;Album details&lt;/li&gt;\\n    &lt;li&gt;...(stuff from the {album.name}&lt;/li&gt;\\n    {album.tracks.map(track =&gt; &lt;li key={track.id} onClick={playTrack(track.id)}&gt;{track.name}&lt;/li&gt;)}\\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\\n)\\n\\nconst AlbumSummary = ({ album }) =&gt; {\\n  &lt;h1&gt;\\n    {album.name}\\n  &lt;/h1&gt;\\n}\\n\\nconst TrackPlayer = ({ track }) =&gt; {\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;h1&gt;{track.title}&lt;/h1&gt;\\n    &lt;AudioPlayer audio={track.audio} /&gt; &lt;!-- pretend this exists --&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n}\\n\\nconst AlbumSummaryContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ album: state.albums.selectedAlbum }))(AlbumSummary)\\nconst AlbumListContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ albums: state.albums.allAlbums }),\\n                                   dispatch =&gt; ({ selectAlbum: id =&gt; dispatch(actions.selectAlbum(id)) }))(AlbumList)\\nconst AlbumDetailContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ album: state.albums.selectedAlbum }),\\n                                     dispatch =&gt; ({ playTrack: id =&gt; dispatch(actions.selectTrack(id)) }))(AlbumDetail)\\nconst TrackPlayerContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ track: state.albums.tracks[state.albums.selectedTrack] }))(TrackPlayer)\\n\\nconst MyComponent = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;Routes&gt;\\n      &lt;Route name=&quot;main&quot; path=&quot;/&quot; /&gt;\\n      &lt;Route name=&quot;albumlist&quot; path=&quot;/albums(/album/:album(/track/:track))&quot;\\n             {...albumRouteMapping}\\n      /&gt;\\n    &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;TwoPanelLayout&gt;\\n      &lt;Panel&gt;\\n        &lt;AlbumToggle component={AlbumSummaryContainer} /&gt;\\n        &lt;TrackToggle component={TrackPlayerContainer} /&gt;\\n      &lt;/Panel&gt;\\n      &lt;Panel&gt;\\n        &lt;AlbumToggle component={AlbumDetailContainer} else={AlbumListContainer} /&gt;\\n      &lt;/Panel&gt;\\n    &lt;/TwoPanelLayout&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In addition, declaring new routes in asynchronously loaded code is trivial with this\\ndesign.  One need only put in <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> declarations in the child code and the new routes\\nwill be added, and also automatically removed if the child code is removed from the\\nrender tree.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"principles\\\">Principles</h2>\\n<p>Most routers start from an assumption that the url determines what part of the application\\nto display.  This results in a tree of urls mapping to components.  Because routes\\nare defined by the URL, it then becomes necessary to provide hooks and an index route, and\\nan unknown route and so on and so forth.</p>\\n<p>However clever one is, this results in a very subtle logic flaw when using redux.  Redux-based\\napplications consider the store state to be a single source of truth.  As such, general \\nstate is not stored inside components, or pulled out of the client-side database or the\\nurl state from pushState/popState.  <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1287\\\">Read more about the state debate</a>.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"url-state-is-just-another-asynchronous-input-to-redux-state\\\">URL state is just another asynchronous input to redux state</h3>\\n<p>We are trained to think of the browser URL as some kind of magic all-knowing state container.\\nSimply because it is there and the user can directly change it to any value. But how different\\nis this really than a database accessed on the server via asynchronous xhr? Or even\\nsynchronous localStorage?  Let&#39;s stop thinking of the URL as a state container.  It\\nis an input that we can use to create state.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"when-the-url-changes-it-should-cause-a-state-change-in-the-redux-store\\\">When the URL changes, it should cause a state change in the redux store</h3>\\n<p>We want our URL to change the way the application works.  This allows users to bookmark a\\nparticular view, such as an email (/inbox/message/243) or a particular todo list filter\\n(/todos/all or /todos/search/house)</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"when-the-state-changes-in-the-redux-store-it-should-be-reflected-in-the-url\\\">When the state changes in the redux store, it should be reflected in the URL</h3>\\n<p>If a user clicks on something that affects the application state by triggering an action,\\nsuch as selecting an email to view, we want the URL to then update so the user can bookmark\\nthat application state or share it.</p>\\n<p>This single principle is the reason for the existence of this router.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"route-definition-is-separate-from-the-components\\\">Route definition is separate from the components</h3>\\n<p>Because URL state is just another input to the redux state, we only need to define\\nhow to transform URLs into redux state.  Components then choose whether to render based\\non that state.  This is a crucial difference from every other router out there.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"components-are-explicitly-used-where-they-go-and-can-be-moved-anywhere\\\">Components are explicitly used where they go, and can be moved anywhere</h3>\\n<p>With traditional routers, you must render the component where the route is declared.\\nThis creates rigidity.  In addition, with programs based on react-router, the link\\nbetween where a component exists and the route lives in the router.  The only indication\\nthat something &quot;routey&quot; is happening is the presence of <code>{this.props.children}</code> which\\ncan make debugging and technical debt higher.  This router restores the natural tree and\\nlayout of a React app: you use the component where it will actually be rendered in the\\ntree.  Less technical debt, less confusion.</p>\\n<p>The drawback is that direct connection between URL and component is less obvious.  The\\ntradeoff seems worth it, as the URL is just another input to the program.  Currently,\\nthe relationship between database definition and component is just as opaque, and that\\nworks just fine, this is no different.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"indexroute-redirect-and-errorroute-are-not-necessary\\\">IndexRoute, Redirect and ErrorRoute are not necessary</h3>\\n<p>Use Toggle and smart (connected) components to do all of this logic.  For example, an\\nerror route is basically a toggle that only displays when other routes are not selected.\\nYou can use the <code>noMatches</code> selector for this purpose.  An indexRoute can be implemented\\nwith the <code>matchedRoute(&#39;/&#39;)</code> selector (and by defining a route for &#39;/&#39;).</p>\\n<p>A redirect can be implemented simply by listening for a URL in a saga and pushing a new\\none:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { replace } from &#39;ion-router&#39;\\nimport { ROUTE } from &#39;ion-router/types&#39;\\nimport { take, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport { createPath } from &#39;history&#39;\\nimport RouteParser from &#39;route-parser&#39; // this is used internally\\n\\nfunction *redirect() {\\n  while (true) {\\n    const action = yield (take(ROUTE))\\n    const parser = new RouteParser(&#39;/old/path/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const newparser = new RouteParser(&#39;/new/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const params = parser.match(createPath(action))\\n    if (params) {\\n      yield put(replace(newparser.reverse(params)))\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3 id=\\\"easy-testing\\\">Easy testing</h3>\\n<p>Everything is properly isolated, and testable.  You can easily unit test your route\\nstateFromParams and paramsFromState and updateState properties.  Components are\\nsimply components, no magic.</p>\\n<p>To set up routes for testing in a unit test, the <code>synchronousMakeRoutes</code> functions is\\navailable.  Pass in an array of routes, and use the return in the reducer</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { synchronousMakeRoutes, routerReducer } from &#39;ion-router&#39;\\n\\ndescribe(&#39;some component that uses routes&#39;, () =&gt; {\\n  let fakeState\\n  beforeEach(() =&gt; {\\n    const action = synchronousMakeRoutes([\\n      {\\n        name: &#39;route1&#39;,\\n        path: &#39;/route1&#39;\\n      },\\n      {\\n        name: &#39;route1&#39;,\\n        path: &#39;/route2/:thing&#39;,\\n        stateToParams: state =&gt; state,\\n        paramsToState: params =&gt; params,\\n        update: {\\n          thing: thing =&gt; ({ type: &#39;changething&#39;, payload: thing })\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ])\\n    fakeState = {\\n      routing: routerReducer(undefined, action)\\n    }\\n  })\\n  it(&#39;test something&#39;, () =&gt; {\\n    // use components that have &lt;Link&gt; or &lt;Toggle&gt;\\n  })\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You will need to set this up for any <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> components that use route to generate\\nthe path, and any components that contain <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> tags when rendering\\nthem.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"license\\\">License</h2>\\n<p>MIT License</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"thanks\\\">Thanks</h2>\\n<p><a

It uses the <code>to</code>\\nprop in place of href.  An onClick handler may be passed to handle the click in\\na custom fashion.  All other props will be passed through to the internal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>\\ntag.</p>\\n<p>If you wish to replace the current url instead of pushing, use the <code>replace</code> prop\\ninstead of the <code>to</code> prop.</p>\\n<p>Unlike any other router, the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component can also create abstract routes\\nfrom a list of route parameters. With this route declaration:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">const routes = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;Route name=&quot;biff&quot; path=&quot;/this/:fancy(/:thing)&quot; /&gt;\\n  &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>we can create a link like so:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">const App = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;Link route=&quot;biff&quot; fancy=&quot;hi&quot; thing={some.dynamicValue} /&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and if the dynamic value refers to <code>123</code> the route will link to <code>/this/hi/123</code></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"extending-the-example-asynchronous-state-loading\\\">Extending the example: asynchronous state loading</h3>\\n<p>What if we are loading the todo list from a database?  There will be a short delay while\\nthe list is loaded, and the user will just see an empty list of todos.  If they add a todo,\\nthe todo id could suddenly conflict with todos the user creates, which would erase them on the\\ndatabase load.  Better is to display a different component while loading.</p>\\n<p>To implement this with our router, you will use:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>a loading component that will be displayed when the todos are loading</li>\\n<li>a &quot;Toggle&quot; higher order component that is used to switch on/off display of a\\ncomponent or its loading component</li>\\n<li>an asynchronous program to load the todos from the database.</li>\\n<li>an additional way of marking whether state is loaded or not in the store, and\\nactions and reducer code to capture this state.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>redux-saga is an excellent solution for expressing complex asynchronous actions in a\\nsimple way.  You can write your asynchronous loader in any manner you choose, whether\\nit is a thunk, saga, observable, or fill-in-your-favorite.</p>\\n<p>For this example, we will assume that you can add a simple &quot;loaded&quot; field to the todos\\nreducer, and actions to set it to true or false.</p>\\n<p>Let&#39;s design the loading component first:</p>\\n<p>Loading.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\n\\nexport default () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;h1&gt;Loading...&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Asynchronous loading of the todo items from the database can be accomplished with a very\\nsimple saga.  The saga assumes that the todos can be accessed via a REST service that\\nreturns JSON, and uses the axios library to make an xhr call to retrieve it from the\\nserver at the <code>&quot;/getTodos&quot;</code> address.</p>\\n<p>loadTodosSaga.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { call, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport axios from &#39;axios&#39;\\n\\nimport * as actions from &#39;./actions&#39;\\n\\nexport default function *loadTodos() {\\n  // mark loading as starting\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(false))\\n  const todos = yield call([axios, axios.get], &#39;/getTodos&#39;)\\n  // a new action for setting all of the todos at once\\n  yield put(actions.setTodos(todos))\\n  // mark loading as finished\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(true))\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now let&#39;s create a Toggle.  A Toggle is a higher order component that responds to state in order\\nto turn on or off the display of a component, like a toggle switch.  It takes 2 callbacks as parameters.\\nEach callback receives the state as a parameter and should return truthy or falsey values.  The first is\\nused to determine whether the main component should be displayed.  The second optional callback is used\\nto determine whether state is still loading, and if so, whether to display the loading component.\\nBy default, if no loading callback is passed in, a Toggle assumes that the state is\\nloaded.</p>\\n<p>In our example, there is only 1 route, and so we will display it if our state is marked\\nas loaded.  If not, we will not display the component.  Instead, we will display the\\nloading component.  Here is the source:</p>\\n<p>TodosToggle.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import Toggle from &#39;ion-router/Toggle&#39;\\n\\nexport default Toggle(state =&gt; state.loaded, state =&gt; !state.loaded)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The TodosToggle is a component that accepts 2 props: <code>component</code> and <code>loadingComponent</code>.\\n<code>component</code> should be a React component or connected container to display if the\\nToggle condition is satisfied, and <code>loadingComponent</code> should be a React component or connected\\ncontainer to display if the loading condition is satisfied.</p>\\n<p>Note that if both callbacks return true, then the loading component will be displayed.</p>\\n<p>Finally, the usage of TodosToggle is straightforward.</p>\\n<p>in App.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\nimport Footer from &#39;./Footer&#39;\\nimport AddTodo from &#39;../containers/AddTodo&#39;\\nimport VisibleTodoList from &#39;../containers/VisibleTodoList&#39;\\n\\nimport Routes from &#39;./Routes&#39;\\nimport Loading from &#39;./Loading&#39;\\nimport TodosToggle from &#39;./TodosToggle&#39;\\n\\nconst App = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;Routes /&gt;\\n    &lt;AddTodo /&gt;\\n    &lt;TodosToggle component={VisibleTodoList} loadingComponent={Loading} /&gt;&lt;!-- simple! --&gt;\\n    &lt;Footer /&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n\\nexport default App\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now our component will display the todo list only when it has loaded.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"common-use-case-displaying-a-component-when-a-route-is-selected\\\">Common use case: displaying a component when a route is selected</h3>\\n<p>In most applications, there are menus that select components based on the user\\nselecting a sub-application.

If the required parameter should\\nbe simply set to undefined upon exiting, then you need to explicitly pass this\\ninto the <code>exitParams</code> prop for <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">exitParams = {\\n  required: undefined\\n}\\nconst Routes = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;Route\\n      name=&quot;test&quot;\\n      path=&quot;/path/:required&quot;\\n      stateToParams={...}\\n      paramsToState={...}\\n      updateState={...}\\n      exitParams={exitParams}\\n    /&gt;\\n  &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If you wish to dynamically set up the parameters based on existing parameters, pass\\nin a function that accepts the previous url&#39;s params as an argument and returns the\\nexit params:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">exitParams = params =&gt; ({\\n  required: params.required,\\n  optional: undefined\\n})\\nconst Routes = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;Route\\n      name=&quot;test&quot;\\n      path=&quot;/path/:required(/:optional)&quot;\\n      stateToParams={...}\\n      paramsToState={...}\\n      updateState={...}\\n      exitParams={exitParams}\\n    /&gt;\\n  &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3 id=\\\"code-splitting-and-asynchronous-loading-of-routes\\\">Code splitting and asynchronous loading of Routes</h3>\\n<p>Routes can be loaded at any time.  If you load a new component asynchronously (using\\nrequire.ensure, for instance), and dynamically add a new <code>&lt;Routes&gt;&lt;Route&gt;...</code> inside that\\ncomponent, the router will seamlessly start using the route.  Code splitting has never\\nbeen simpler.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"server-side-rendering\\\">Server-side Rendering</h3>\\n<p>When rendering routes on the server, there are 2 options.  No changes need be made\\nto the component source.  However, because of the way server rendering works, multiple\\nactions and re-renders will occur when setting up routes.  To avoid the performance\\npenalty for complex applications, an optional third parameter to the router setup\\ncan be used to pass in the routes.  The definition of routes is an object with the\\nsame keys as the props one would pass to a <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> tag.</p>\\n<p>so instead of:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">// set up our router\\nmakeRouter(connect, store)\\n\\nexitParams = params =&gt; ({\\n  required: params.required,\\n  optional: undefined\\n})\\nconst Routes = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;Route\\n      name=&quot;test&quot;\\n      path=&quot;/path/:required(/:optional)&quot;\\n      stateToParams={...}\\n      paramsToState={...}\\n      updateState={...}\\n      exitParams={exitParams}\\n    /&gt;\\n  &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>one would use:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">exitParams = params =&gt; ({\\n  required: params.required,\\n  optional: undefined\\n})\\n\\n// set up our router\\nmakeRouter(connect, store, [{\\n  name: &#39;test&#39;,\\n  path: &#39;/path/:required(/:optional)&#39;,\\n  stateToParams=...,\\n  paramsToState=...,\\n  updateState={...},\\n  exitParams={exitParams},\\n}])\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The same setup can be used on both client and server for root routes, so there is no\\nneed to keep the <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> elements in your component tree if\\nyou choose to initialize on start-up.  You should continue to use the components for\\ndynamic routes loaded later.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"explicitly-changing-url\\\">Explicitly changing URL</h3>\\n<p>A number of actions are provided to change the browser state directly, most useful\\nfor menus and other direct links.</p>\\n<p>ion-router uses the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/mjackson/history\\\">history</a> package\\ninternally.

Why create a new router?\\nIn my work with react-router, I found that it was not possible to achieve\\nsome basic goals using react-router. I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to store state from\\nurl parameters and easily change the url from the state when using redux. It is the\\nclassic two-way binding issue: if there are 2 sources of state, they will fight and\\ncause unexpected bugs.</p>\\n<p>In addition, I moved to redux for state because the tree of components in React rarely\\ncorresponds to the way data is used.  In many cases, I find myself rendering different\\nportions of the component tree using the same data. So I will have 2 React components\\nin totally different parts of the component tree using the same piece of data.\\nWith react-router, I found myself duplicating a lot of content with a single component,\\nor using complex routing rules to enable displaying this information.  react-router\\nversion 4 allows declaring the same route multiple times throughout the code, but\\nthis can make things more confusing, and opens up another vector for bugs since\\nroute information must be duplicated wherever it is used.</p>\\n<p>With ion-router, multiple components can respond to a route change anywhere\\nin the React component tree, allowing for more modular design.  The below solution\\nis more performant both because the components\\nare not rendered at all if the route is not satisfied.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\nimport Routes from &#39;ion-router/Routes&#39;\\nimport Route from &#39;ion-router/Route&#39;\\nimport Toggle from &#39;ion-router/Toggle&#39;\\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;\\n\\nimport * as actions from &#39;./actions&#39;\\n\\nconst albumRouteMapping = {\\n  stateFromParams: params =&gt; ({ id: params.album, track: +params.track }),\\n  paramsFromState: state =&gt; ({\\n    album: state.albums.selectedAlbum.id,\\n    track: state.albums.selectedTrack ? state.albums.selectedTrack : undefined\\n  }),\\n  updateState: {\\n    id: id =&gt; actions.selectAlbum(id),\\n    track: (track, state) =&gt; state.id &amp;&amp; actions.playTrack(track)\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconst TrackToggle = Toggle(state =&gt; state.albums.selectedTrack,\\n                           state =&gt; state.albums.selectedTrack\\n                            &amp;&amp; state.albums.allTracks[state.albums.selectedTrack].loading)\\nconst AlbumToggle = Toggle(state =&gt; state.albums.selectedAlbum)\\n\\nconst AlbumList = ({ albums, selectAlbum }) =&gt; (\\n  &lt;ul&gt;\\n    {albums.map(album =&gt; &lt;li key={album.id} onClick={selectAlbum(album.id)}&gt;{album.name}&lt;/li&gt;)}\\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\\n)\\n\\nconst AlbumDetail = ({ album, playTrack }) =&gt; (\\n  &lt;ul&gt;\\n    &lt;li&gt;Album details&lt;/li&gt;\\n    &lt;li&gt;...(stuff from the {album.name}&lt;/li&gt;\\n    {album.tracks.map(track =&gt; &lt;li key={track.id} onClick={playTrack(track.id)}&gt;{track.name}&lt;/li&gt;)}\\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\\n)\\n\\nconst AlbumSummary = ({ album }) =&gt; {\\n  &lt;h1&gt;\\n    {album.name}\\n  &lt;/h1&gt;\\n}\\n\\nconst TrackPlayer = ({ track }) =&gt; {\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;h1&gt;{track.title}&lt;/h1&gt;\\n    &lt;AudioPlayer audio={track.audio} /&gt; &lt;!-- pretend this exists --&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n}\\n\\nconst AlbumSummaryContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ album: state.albums.selectedAlbum }))(AlbumSummary)\\nconst AlbumListContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ albums: state.albums.allAlbums }),\\n                                   dispatch =&gt; ({ selectAlbum: id =&gt; dispatch(actions.selectAlbum(id)) }))(AlbumList)\\nconst AlbumDetailContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ album: state.albums.selectedAlbum }),\\n                                     dispatch =&gt; ({ playTrack: id =&gt; dispatch(actions.selectTrack(id)) }))(AlbumDetail)\\nconst TrackPlayerContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ track: state.albums.tracks[state.albums.selectedTrack] }))(TrackPlayer)\\n\\nconst MyComponent = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;Routes&gt;\\n      &lt;Route name=&quot;main&quot; path=&quot;/&quot; /&gt;\\n      &lt;Route name=&quot;albumlist&quot; path=&quot;/albums(/album/:album(/track/:track))&quot;\\n             {...albumRouteMapping}\\n      /&gt;\\n    &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;TwoPanelLayout&gt;\\n      &lt;Panel&gt;\\n        &lt;AlbumToggle component={AlbumSummaryContainer} /&gt;\\n        &lt;TrackToggle component={TrackPlayerContainer} /&gt;\\n      &lt;/Panel&gt;\\n      &lt;Panel&gt;\\n        &lt;AlbumToggle component={AlbumDetailContainer} else={AlbumListContainer} /&gt;\\n      &lt;/Panel&gt;\\n    &lt;/TwoPanelLayout&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In addition, declaring new routes in asynchronously loaded code is trivial with this\\ndesign.  One need only put in <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> declarations in the child code and the new routes\\nwill be added, and also automatically removed if the child code is removed from the\\nrender tree.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"principles\\\">Principles</h2>\\n<p>Most routers start from an assumption that the url determines what part of the application\\nto display.  This results in a tree of urls mapping to components.  Because routes\\nare defined by the URL, it then becomes necessary to provide hooks and an index route, and\\nan unknown route and so on and so forth.</p>\\n<p>However clever one is, this results in a very subtle logic flaw when using redux.  Redux-based\\napplications consider the store state to be a single source of truth.  As such, general \\nstate is not stored inside components, or pulled out of the client-side database or the\\nurl state from pushState/popState.  <a href=\\\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1287\\\">Read more about the state debate</a>.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"url-state-is-just-another-asynchronous-input-to-redux-state\\\">URL state is just another asynchronous input to redux state</h3>\\n<p>We are trained to think of the browser URL as some kind of magic all-knowing state container.\\nSimply because it is there and the user can directly change it to any value. But how different\\nis this really than a database accessed on the server via asynchronous xhr? Or even\\nsynchronous localStorage?  Let&#39;s stop thinking of the URL as a state container.  It\\nis an input that we can use to create state.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"when-the-url-changes-it-should-cause-a-state-change-in-the-redux-store\\\">When the URL changes, it should cause a state change in the redux store</h3>\\n<p>We want our URL to change the way the application works.  This allows users to bookmark a\\nparticular view, such as an email (/inbox/message/243) or a particular todo list filter\\n(/todos/all or /todos/search/house)</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"when-the-state-changes-in-the-redux-store-it-should-be-reflected-in-the-url\\\">When the state changes in the redux store, it should be reflected in the URL</h3>\\n<p>If a user clicks on something that affects the application state by triggering an action,\\nsuch as selecting an email to view, we want the URL to then update so the user can bookmark\\nthat application state or share it.</p>\\n<p>This single principle is the reason for the existence of this router.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"route-definition-is-separate-from-the-components\\\">Route definition is separate from the components</h3>\\n<p>Because URL state is just another input to the redux state, we only need to define\\nhow to transform URLs into redux state.  Components then choose whether to render based\\non that state.  This is a crucial difference from every other router out there.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"components-are-explicitly-used-where-they-go-and-can-be-moved-anywhere\\\">Components are explicitly used where they go, and can be moved anywhere</h3>\\n<p>With traditional routers, you must render the component where the route is declared.\\nThis creates rigidity.  In addition, with programs based on react-router, the link\\nbetween where a component exists and the route lives in the router.  The only indication\\nthat something &quot;routey&quot; is happening is the presence of <code>{this.props.children}</code> which\\ncan make debugging and technical debt higher.  This router restores the natural tree and\\nlayout of a React app: you use the component where it will actually be rendered in the\\ntree.  Less technical debt, less confusion.</p>\\n<p>The drawback is that direct connection between URL and component is less obvious.  The\\ntradeoff seems worth it, as the URL is just another input to the program.  Currently,\\nthe relationship between database definition and component is just as opaque, and that\\nworks just fine, this is no different.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"indexroute-redirect-and-errorroute-are-not-necessary\\\">IndexRoute, Redirect and ErrorRoute are not necessary</h3>\\n<p>Use Toggle and smart (connected) components to do all of this logic.  For example, an\\nerror route is basically a toggle that only displays when other routes are not selected.\\nYou can use the <code>noMatches</code> selector for this purpose.  An indexRoute can be implemented\\nwith the <code>matchedRoute(&#39;/&#39;)</code> selector (and by defining a route for &#39;/&#39;).</p>\\n<p>A redirect can be implemented simply by listening for a URL in a saga and pushing a new\\none:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { replace } from &#39;ion-router&#39;\\nimport { ROUTE } from &#39;ion-router/types&#39;\\nimport { take, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport { createPath } from &#39;history&#39;\\nimport RouteParser from &#39;route-parser&#39; // this is used internally\\n\\nfunction *redirect() {\\n  while (true) {\\n    const action = yield (take(ROUTE))\\n    const parser = new RouteParser(&#39;/old/path/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const newparser = new RouteParser(&#39;/new/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const params = parser.match(createPath(action))\\n    if (params) {\\n      yield put(replace(newparser.reverse(params)))\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3 id=\\\"easy-testing\\\">Easy testing</h3>\\n<p>Everything is properly isolated, and testable.  You can easily unit test your route\\nstateFromParams and paramsFromState and updateState properties.  Components are\\nsimply components, no magic.</p>\\n<p>To set up routes for testing in a unit test, the <code>synchronousMakeRoutes</code> functions is\\navailable.  Pass in an array of routes, and use the return in the reducer</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { synchronousMakeRoutes, routerReducer } from
