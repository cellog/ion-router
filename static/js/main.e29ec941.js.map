There will be a short delay while\\nthe list is loaded, and the user will just see an empty list of todos.  If they add a todo,\\nthe todo id could suddenly conflict with todos the user creates, which would erase them on the\\ndatabase load.  Better is to display a different component while loading.</p>\\n<p>To implement this with our router, you will use:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>a loading component that will be displayed when the todos are loading</li>\\n<li>a &quot;Toggle&quot; higher order component that is used to switch on/off display of a\\ncomponent or its loading component</li>\\n<li>an asynchronous program to load the todos from the database.</li>\\n<li>an additional way of marking whether state is loaded or not in the store, and\\nactions and reducer code to capture this state.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>redux-saga is an excellent solution for expressing complex asynchronous actions in a\\nsimple way.  You can write your asynchronous loader in any manner you choose, whether\\nit is a thunk, saga, observable, or fill-in-your-favorite.</p>\\n<p>For this example, we will assume that you can add a simple &quot;loaded&quot; field to the todos\\nreducer, and actions to set it to true or false.</p>\\n<p>Let&#39;s design the loading component first:</p>\\n<p>Loading.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\n\\nexport default () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;h1&gt;Loading...&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Asynchronous loading of the todo items from the database can be accomplished with a very\\nsimple saga.  The saga assumes that the todos can be accessed via a REST service that\\nreturns JSON, and uses the axios library to make an xhr call to retrieve it from the\\nserver at the <code>&quot;/getTodos&quot;</code> address.</p>\\n<p>loadTodosSaga.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { call, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport axios from &#39;axios&#39;\\n\\nimport * as actions from &#39;./actions&#39;\\n\\nexport default function *loadTodos() {\\n  // mark loading as starting\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(false))\\n  const todos = yield call([axios, axios.get], &#39;/getTodos&#39;)\\n  // a new action for setting all of the todos at once\\n  yield put(actions.setTodos(todos))\\n  // mark loading as finished\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(true))\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now let&#39;s create a Toggle.  A Toggle is a higher order component that responds to state in order\\nto turn on or off the display of a component, like a toggle switch.  It takes 2 callbacks as parameters.\\nEach callback receives the state as a parameter and should return truthy or falsey values.  The first is\\nused to determine whether the main component should be displayed.  The second optional callback is used\\nto determine whether state is still loading, and if so, whether to display the loading component.\\nBy default, if no loading callback is passed in, a Toggle assumes that the state is\\nloaded.</p>\\n<p>In our example, there is only 1 route, and so we will display it if our state is marked\\nas loaded.

Why create a new router?\\nIn my work with react-router, I found that it was not possible to achieve\\nsome basic goals using react-router. I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to store state from\\nurl parameters and easily change the url from the state when using redux. It is the\\nclassic two-way binding issue: if there are 2 sources of state, they will fight and\\ncause unexpected bugs.</p>\\n<p>In addition, I moved to redux for state because the tree of components in React rarely\\ncorresponds to the way data is used.  In many cases, I find myself rendering different\\nportions of the component tree using the same data. So I will have 2 React components\\nin totally different parts of the component tree using the same piece of data.\\nWith react-router, I found myself duplicating a lot of content with a single component,\\nor using complex routing rules to enable displaying this information.  react-router\\nversion 4 allows declaring the same route multiple times throughout the code, but\\nthis can make things more confusing, and opens up another vector for bugs since\\nroute information must be duplicated wherever it is used.</p>\\n<p>With ion-router, multiple components can respond to a route change anywhere\\nin the React component tree, allowing for more modular design.

In addition, with programs based on react-router, the link\\nbetween where a component exists and the route lives in the router.  The only indication\\nthat something &quot;routey&quot; is happening is the presence of <code>{this.props.children}</code> which\\ncan make debugging and technical debt higher.  This router restores the natural tree and\\nlayout of a React app: you use the component where it will actually be rendered in the\\ntree.  Less technical debt, less confusion.</p>\\n<p>The drawback is that direct connection between URL and component is less obvious.  The\\ntradeoff seems worth it, as the URL is just another input to the program.  Currently,\\nthe relationship between database definition and component is just as opaque, and that\\nworks just fine, this is no different.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"indexroute-redirect-and-errorroute-are-not-necessary\\\">IndexRoute, Redirect and ErrorRoute are not necessary</h3>\\n<p>Use Toggle and smart (connected) components to do all of this logic.  For example, an\\nerror route is basically a toggle that only displays when other routes are not selected.\\nYou can use the <code>noMatches</code> selector for this purpose.  An indexRoute can be implemented\\nwith the <code>matchedRoute(&#39;/&#39;)</code> selector (and by defining a route for &#39;/&#39;).</p>\\n<p>A redirect can be implemented simply by listening for a URL in a saga and pushing a new\\none:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { replace } from &#39;ion-router&#39;\\nimport { ROUTE } from &#39;ion-router/types&#39;\\nimport { take, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport { createPath } from &#39;history&#39;\\nimport RouteParser from &#39;route-parser&#39; // this is used internally\\n\\nfunction *redirect() {\\n  while (true) {\\n    const action = yield (take(ROUTE))\\n    const parser = new RouteParser(&#39;/old/path/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const newparser = new RouteParser(&#39;/new/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const params = parser.match(createPath(action))\\n    if (params) {\\n      yield put(replace(newparser.reverse(params)))\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3 id=\\\"easy-testing\\\">Easy testing</h3>\\n<p>Everything is properly isolated, and testable.  You can easily unit test your route\\nstateFromParams and paramsFromState and updateState properties.  Components are\\nsimply components, no magic.</p>\\n<p>To set up routes for testing in a unit test, the <code>synchronousMakeRoutes</code> functions is\\navailable.  Pass in an array of routes, and use the return in the reducer</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { synchronousMakeRoutes, routerReducer } from &#39;ion-router&#39;\\n\\ndescribe(&#39;some component that uses routes&#39;, () =&gt; {\\n  let fakeState\\n  beforeEach(() =&gt; {\\n    const action = synchronousMakeRoutes([\\n      {\\n        name: &#39;route1&#39;,\\n        path: &#39;/route1&#39;\\n      },\\n      {\\n        name: &#39;route1&#39;,\\n        path: &#39;/route2/:thing&#39;,\\n        stateToParams: state =&gt; state,\\n        paramsToState: params =&gt; params,\\n        update: {\\n          thing: thing =&gt; ({ type: &#39;changething&#39;, payload: thing })\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ])\\n    fakeState = {\\n      routing: routerReducer(undefined, action)\\n    }\\n  })\\n  it(&#39;test something&#39;, () =&gt; {\\n    // use components that have &lt;Link&gt; or &lt;Toggle&gt;\\n  })\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You will need to set this up for any <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> components that use route to generate\\nthe path, and any components that contain <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> tags when rendering\\nthem.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"license\\\">License</h2>\\n<p>MIT License</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"thanks\\\">Thanks</h2>\\n<p><a

It uses the <code>to</code>\\nprop in place of href.  An onClick handler may be passed to handle the click in\\na custom fashion.  All other props will be passed through to the internal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>\\ntag.</p>\\n<p>If you wish to replace the current url instead of pushing, use the <code>replace</code> prop\\ninstead of the <code>to</code> prop.</p>\\n<p>Unlike any other router, the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component can also create abstract routes\\nfrom a list of route parameters. With this route declaration:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">const routes = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;Route name=&quot;biff&quot; path=&quot;/this/:fancy(/:thing)&quot; /&gt;\\n  &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>we can create a link like so:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">const App = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;Link route=&quot;biff&quot; fancy=&quot;hi&quot; thing={some.dynamicValue} /&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>and if the dynamic value refers to <code>123</code> the route will link to <code>/this/hi/123</code></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"extending-the-example-asynchronous-state-loading\\\">Extending the example: asynchronous state loading</h3>\\n<p>What if we are loading the todo list from a database?  There will be a short delay while\\nthe list is loaded, and the user will just see an empty list of todos.  If they add a todo,\\nthe todo id could suddenly conflict with todos the user creates, which would erase them on the\\ndatabase load.  Better is to display a different component while loading.</p>\\n<p>To implement this with our router, you will use:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>a loading component that will be displayed when the todos are loading</li>\\n<li>a &quot;Toggle&quot; higher order component that is used to switch on/off display of a\\ncomponent or its loading component</li>\\n<li>an asynchronous program to load the todos from the database.</li>\\n<li>an additional way of marking whether state is loaded or not in the store, and\\nactions and reducer code to capture this state.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>redux-saga is an excellent solution for expressing complex asynchronous actions in a\\nsimple way.  You can write your asynchronous loader in any manner you choose, whether\\nit is a thunk, saga, observable, or fill-in-your-favorite.</p>\\n<p>For this example, we will assume that you can add a simple &quot;loaded&quot; field to the todos\\nreducer, and actions to set it to true or false.</p>\\n<p>Let&#39;s design the loading component first:</p>\\n<p>Loading.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\n\\nexport default () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;h1&gt;Loading...&lt;/h1&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Asynchronous loading of the todo items from the database can be accomplished with a very\\nsimple saga.  The saga assumes that the todos can be accessed via a REST service that\\nreturns JSON, and uses the axios library to make an xhr call to retrieve it from the\\nserver at the <code>&quot;/getTodos&quot;</code> address.</p>\\n<p>loadTodosSaga.js:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { call, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport axios from &#39;axios&#39;\\n\\nimport * as actions from &#39;./actions&#39;\\n\\nexport default function *loadTodos() {\\n  // mark loading as starting\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(false))\\n  const todos = yield call([axios, axios.get], &#39;/getTodos&#39;)\\n  // a new action for setting all of the todos at once\\n  yield put(actions.setTodos(todos))\\n  // mark loading as finished\\n  yield put(actions.setLoaded(true))\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now let&#39;s create a Toggle.  A Toggle is a higher order component that responds to state in order\\nto turn on or off the display of a component, like a toggle switch.  It takes 2 callbacks as parameters.\\nEach callback receives the state as a parameter and should return truthy or falsey values.  The first is\\nused to determine whether the main component should be displayed.  The second optional callback is used\\nto determine whether state is still loading, and if so, whether to display the loading component.\\nBy default, if no loading callback is passed in, a Toggle assumes that the state is\\nloaded.</p>\\n<p>In our example, there is only 1 route, and so we will display it if our state is marked\\nas loaded.  If not, we will not display the component.  Instead, we will display the\\nloading component.

Why create a new router?\\nIn my work with react-router, I found that it was not possible to achieve\\nsome basic goals using react-router. I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to store state from\\nurl parameters and easily change the url from the state when using redux. It is the\\nclassic two-way binding issue: if there are 2 sources of state, they will fight and\\ncause unexpected bugs.</p>\\n<p>In addition, I moved to redux for state because the tree of components in React rarely\\ncorresponds to the way data is used.  In many cases, I find myself rendering different\\nportions of the component tree using the same data. So I will have 2 React components\\nin totally different parts of the component tree using the same piece of data.\\nWith react-router, I found myself duplicating a lot of content with a single component,\\nor using complex routing rules to enable displaying this information.  react-router\\nversion 4 allows declaring the same route multiple times throughout the code, but\\nthis can make things more confusing, and opens up another vector for bugs since\\nroute information must be duplicated wherever it is used.</p>\\n<p>With ion-router, multiple components can respond to a route change anywhere\\nin the React component tree, allowing for more modular design.  The below solution\\nis more performant both because the components\\nare not rendered at all if the route is not satisfied.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import React from &#39;react&#39;\\nimport Routes from &#39;ion-router/Routes&#39;\\nimport Route from &#39;ion-router/Route&#39;\\nimport Toggle from &#39;ion-router/Toggle&#39;\\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;\\n\\nimport * as actions from &#39;./actions&#39;\\n\\nconst albumRouteMapping = {\\n  stateFromParams: params =&gt; ({ id: params.album, track: +params.track }),\\n  paramsFromState: state =&gt; ({\\n    album: state.albums.selectedAlbum.id,\\n    track: state.albums.selectedTrack ? state.albums.selectedTrack : undefined\\n  }),\\n  updateState: {\\n    id: id =&gt; actions.selectAlbum(id),\\n    track: track =&gt; actions.playTrack(track)\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nconst TrackToggle = Toggle(state =&gt; state.albums.selectedTrack,\\n                           state =&gt; state.albums.selectedTrack\\n                            &amp;&amp; state.albums.allTracks[state.albums.selectedTrack].loading)\\nconst AlbumToggle = Toggle(state =&gt; state.albums.selectedAlbum)\\n\\nconst AlbumList = ({ albums, selectAlbum }) =&gt; (\\n  &lt;ul&gt;\\n    {albums.map(album =&gt; &lt;li key={album.id} onClick={selectAlbum(album.id)}&gt;{album.name}&lt;/li&gt;)}\\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\\n)\\n\\nconst AlbumDetail = ({ album, playTrack }) =&gt; (\\n  &lt;ul&gt;\\n    &lt;li&gt;Album details&lt;/li&gt;\\n    &lt;li&gt;...(stuff from the {album.name}&lt;/li&gt;\\n    {album.tracks.map(track =&gt; &lt;li key={track.id} onClick={playTrack(track.id)}&gt;{track.name}&lt;/li&gt;)}\\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\\n)\\n\\nconst AlbumSummary = ({ album }) =&gt; {\\n  &lt;h1&gt;\\n    {album.name}\\n  &lt;/h1&gt;\\n}\\n\\nconst TrackPlayer = ({ track }) =&gt; {\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;h1&gt;{track.title}&lt;/h1&gt;\\n    &lt;AudioPlayer audio={track.audio} /&gt; &lt;!-- pretend this exists --&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n}\\n\\nconst AlbumSummaryContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ album: state.albums.selectedAlbum }))(AlbumSummary)\\nconst AlbumListContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ albums: state.albums.allAlbums }),\\n                                   dispatch =&gt; ({ selectAlbum: id =&gt; dispatch(actions.selectAlbum(id)) }))(AlbumList)\\nconst AlbumDetailContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ album: state.albums.selectedAlbum }),\\n                                     dispatch =&gt; ({ playTrack: id =&gt; dispatch(actions.selectTrack(id)) }))(AlbumDetail)\\nconst TrackPlayerContainer = connect(state =&gt; ({ track: state.albums.tracks[state.albums.selectedTrack] }))(TrackPlayer)\\n\\nconst MyComponent = () =&gt; (\\n  &lt;div&gt;\\n    &lt;Routes&gt;\\n      &lt;Route name=&quot;main&quot; path=&quot;/&quot; /&gt;\\n      &lt;Route name=&quot;albumlist&quot; path=&quot;/albums(/album/:album(/track/:track))&quot;\\n             {...albumRouteMapping}\\n      /&gt;\\n    &lt;/Routes&gt;\\n    &lt;TwoPanelLayout&gt;\\n      &lt;Panel&gt;\\n        &lt;AlbumToggle component={AlbumSummaryContainer} /&gt;\\n        &lt;TrackToggle component={TrackPlayerContainer} /&gt;\\n      &lt;/Panel&gt;\\n      &lt;Panel&gt;\\n        &lt;AlbumToggle component={AlbumDetailContainer} else={AlbumListContainer} /&gt;\\n      &lt;/Panel&gt;\\n    &lt;/TwoPanelLayout&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In addition, declaring new routes in asynchronously loaded code is trivial with this\\ndesign.

Redux-based\\napplications consider the store state to be a single source of truth.

The only indication\\nthat something &quot;routey&quot; is happening is the presence of <code>{this.props.children}</code> which\\ncan make debugging and technical debt higher.  This router restores the natural tree and\\nlayout of a React app: you use the component where it will actually be rendered in the\\ntree.  Less technical debt, less confusion.</p>\\n<p>The drawback is that direct connection between URL and component is less obvious.  The\\ntradeoff seems worth it, as the URL is just another input to the program.  Currently,\\nthe relationship between database definition and component is just as opaque, and that\\nworks just fine, this is no different.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"indexroute-redirect-and-errorroute-are-not-necessary\\\">IndexRoute, Redirect and ErrorRoute are not necessary</h3>\\n<p>Use Toggle and smart (connected) components to do all of this logic.  For example, an\\nerror route is basically a toggle that only displays when other routes are not selected.\\nYou can use the <code>noMatches</code> selector for this purpose.  An indexRoute can be implemented\\nwith the <code>matchedRoute(&#39;/&#39;)</code> selector (and by defining a route for &#39;/&#39;).</p>\\n<p>A redirect can be implemented simply by listening for a URL in a saga and pushing a new\\none:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { replace } from &#39;ion-router&#39;\\nimport { ROUTE } from &#39;ion-router/types&#39;\\nimport { take, put } from &#39;redux-saga/effects&#39;\\nimport { createPath } from &#39;history&#39;\\nimport RouteParser from &#39;route-parser&#39; // this is used internally\\n\\nfunction *redirect() {\\n  while (true) {\\n    const action = yield (take(ROUTE))\\n    const parser = new RouteParser(&#39;/old/path/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const newparser = new RouteParser(&#39;/new/:is/:this&#39;)\\n    const params = parser.match(createPath(action))\\n    if (params) {\\n      yield put(replace(newparser.reverse(params)))\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3 id=\\\"easy-testing\\\">Easy testing</h3>\\n<p>Everything is properly isolated, and testable.  You can easily unit test your route\\nstateFromParams and paramsFromState and updateState properties.  Components are\\nsimply components, no magic.</p>\\n<p>To set up routes for testing in a unit test, the <code>synchronousMakeRoutes</code> functions is\\navailable.  Pass in an array of routes, and use the return in the reducer</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-javascript\\\">import { synchronousMakeRoutes, routerReducer } from &#39;ion-router&#39;\\n\\ndescribe(&#39;some component that uses routes&#39;, () =&gt; {\\n  let fakeState\\n  beforeEach(() =&gt; {\\n    const action = synchronousMakeRoutes([\\n      {\\n        name: &#39;route1&#39;,\\n        path: &#39;/route1&#39;\\n      },\\n      {\\n        name: &#39;route1&#39;,\\n        path: &#39;/route2/:thing&#39;,\\n        stateToParams: state =&gt; state,\\n        paramsToState: params =&gt; params,\\n        update: {\\n          thing: thing =&gt; ({ type: &#39;changething&#39;, payload: thing })\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ])\\n    fakeState = {\\n      routing: routerReducer(undefined, action)\\n    }\\n  })\\n  it(&#39;test something&#39;, () =&gt; {\\n    // use components that have &lt;Link&gt; or &lt;Toggle&gt;\\n  })\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You will need to set this up for any <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> components that use route to generate\\nthe path, and any components that contain <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> tags when rendering\\nthem.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"license\\\">License</h2>\\n<p>MIT License</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"thanks\\\">Thanks</h2>\\n<p><a
